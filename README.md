# Random GIF Generator

This is a simple Next.js website that generates a random word, searches the Giphy API for a GIF with that word, and displays the GIF on the page.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your computer:

Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org/.

Next.js CLI: To install the Next.js CLI, open a terminal window and enter the following command:

`npm install -g next`

## Running the Project

To run this project on your local development server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/random-gif-generator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd random-gif-generator`
3. Install the project dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Replace your-giphy-api-key with your actual Giphy API key in the API_KEY constant in the pages/index.js file.
5. Start the development server:
   `npm run dev`

This will start the development server and open your project in a new browser window at http://localhost:3000. You should see a button on the page that says "Generate new GIF", and when you click the button, a new random GIF should be displayed on the page.

## Customizing the Project

You can customize this project by modifying the following:

- The array of possible words: By default, the project uses an array of five words (cat, dog, bird, fish, and lizard) to generate the random word. You can modify this array to include any words you like.
- The Giphy API key: You can use your own Giphy API key to access Giphy's content and resources. To get a Giphy API key, sign up for a Giphy account and apply for an API key on the Giphy Developers page at https://developers.giphy.com/.
- The style of the page: You can use CSS to style the page however you like. The project includes a simple white background and blue button, but you can modify the CSS to change the appearance of the page.
